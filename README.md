# Ranked To-Do List

A to-do list application that calculates the priority of a task to help you decide what to complete first.

## Why

Back in highschool, my friend and I found ourselves overwhelmed with work in the IB curriculum. I reckon most people at some point have felt overwhelmed where they don’t know where to begin too. At that time, my friend and I created an excel spreadsheet to list our tasks and due dates.

After some thinking, it struck me that a generic to-do list wasn’t helping me decide which task to complete first, especially when school demanded that we concurrently work on three research projects. Thus, I found some parameters that aided such decision-making: my progress on the task so far, and my perceived difficulty of the task. 

I then worked on a "score" which would help calculate the priority of the task, and used fancy Excel features to automate sorting accordingly. I believe this listing system helped me map my work as I jumped from task-to-task.

Additionally, in ECON 360 at the University of Michigan in Fall 2019, I learned about how procrastination affects our perception of the importance of tasks/rewards. This list requires the user to define the perceived difficulty of a task, which aids in calculating the priority of the task. The difficulty should not be modified later, and the user should be disciplined in estimating difficulty.

Now, sitting at home, bored in self-isolation, I thought it would be fun to revive this project and convert it into a form that others can use. I also hope to implement more math from procrastination study models to improve calculations.
